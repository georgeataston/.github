# George's University Work
Welcome! Here you will find all the coursework (via my website) and programming projects I completed whilst studying for my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at Aston University.

First and second year work is now available [on my website](https://aston.georgehotten.uk).

I'm currently on my placement year (2025-26), so no new work will be added here any time soon!

❤️✨
